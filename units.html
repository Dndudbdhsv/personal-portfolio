            My Academic Journey in My IT Course
        </h3>
        <p class="info">Throughout my academic journey, I have engaged with a range of diverse and challenging units that have significantly shaped my understanding of computing and digital technologies. Unit 1: Online World provided a fundamental insight into how the internet operates, covering topics such as data transmission, cloud computing, online security, and the impact of emerging technologies on society. Unit 2: Technology Systems further built upon this by exploring the internal workings of computer systems, including hardware components, software applications, data storage, and system architecture, equipping me with a strong technical foundation. My studies in Units 3 and 13: Website Development allowed me to develop essential web design and development skills, from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming to user experience (UX) principles, responsive design, and website optimisation techniques. These units also emphasised the importance of accessibility, interactivity, and maintaining industry standards in web development. Additionally, Unit 9: Spreadsheet Development introduced me to the power of data analysis and automation through spreadsheet applications, where I learned advanced functions, formulas, macros, and data visualisation techniques to support business decision-making. Networking concepts were thoroughly explored in Unit 11: Computer Networks, where I gained hands-on experience in configuring network devices, understanding protocols such as TCP/IP, and implementing security measures to ensure reliable communication across local and wide-area networks. Unit 12: Software Development played a crucial role in enhancing my programming abilities, teaching me about software development methodologies, object-oriented programming, debugging, and writing efficient, maintainable code for real-world applications. Lastly, Unit 14: Computer Hardware deepened my knowledge of computer components, system assembly, troubleshooting, and performance optimisation, providing valuable insight into how hardware and software interact. Each of these units has strengthened my technical expertise and problem-solving skills, preparing me for a career in the ever-evolving field of computing.</p>
